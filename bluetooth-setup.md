#How to set up Blueetooth on your Raspberry Pi
Bluetooth can be used to transfer files and communication but will also let you use game controllers such at the Nintendo Wiimote and the PS3 controller for robotics.

You will need a Bluetooth dongle. We use this one (not all of them work on the Pi).

- At the command line type type `sudo apt-get install xxxxx`
